## 📊 Results Framework (JS Function)

```javascript
// Statistical significance testing
function calculateSignificance(conversionsA, visitorsA, conversionsB, visitorsB) {
  const rateA = conversionsA / visitorsA;
  const rateB = conversionsB / visitorsB;
  const pooledRate = (conversionsA + conversionsB) / (visitorsA + visitorsB);

  const standardError = Math.sqrt(
    pooledRate * (1 - pooledRate) * (1/visitorsA + 1/visitorsB)
  );

  const zScore = (rateB - rateA) / standardError;
  return Math.abs(zScore) > 1.96; // 95% confidence level
}
